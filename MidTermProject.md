# Admission_Prediction
Graduate Admission Prediction Model  
**A graduate application is to be completed by a student who wants to enroll in a Master's or doctoral degree. A graduate application will be reviewed by the department that the student applies to by a Graduate Program Director and/or an admissions committee.**  
**So in this dataset we will predict the chance of getting admitted to the applied branch or college.**
This is a **Regression** Problem.

From the [notebook](./notebook.ipynb) it is very much clear that, Linear Regression returned maximum score. Thus the model is built on the basis of Linear Regression Algorithm.
